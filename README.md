# Ruby Chess

Chess is the final project from the [Odin Project's Ruby Programming course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming). There are two types ruby classes in my development:

 - Piece classes: As its name says, they are the root of the pieces in the chess game, with a method that sets the movements of each one.
 - Main class: The Chess class that includes all the pieces and that is the game itself.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NotAProgrammerdork/ruby-chess.git
